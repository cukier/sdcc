Dear user,

this package contains 3 files :

     - readme.txt    (you read it right now !)
     - TG_4bitLCD.c
     - regc51fx.h

TG_4bitLCD.c is piece of code out of my project, which brings you some
basic LCD controlling functions (see comments).

regc51fx.h is a header file for the Intel 8xC51Fx-series to use with SDCC.
All definitions and declarations are taken from the Phillips Data Handbook IC20.

Questions and/or suggestions are welcome.

Regards, Thorsten Godau
